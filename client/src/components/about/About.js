                <h3>Humane Technology Statement</h3>
                <p>As humans, we love tools that make our lives easier. Think about... However, in this digital age, social media
                    is no longer a tool. A tool sits there just waiting to be used. Social media pokes and prods, manipulating you
                    every minute you use it. Art Fair 3.0 seeks to be the start of a new form of social media,
                    a more humane social media.
