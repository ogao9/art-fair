# Design.io

Design.io is an online platform where everyone, not just professionals, can share and get inspired by designs. The mission of Design.io is to increase people's awareness of simple design opportunities so that you can point to things around your home and say: "Hey, I designed that."

The site is live at: https://design-io.herokuapp.com/

## My Motivation
I built Design.io because I was doing a lot of cleaning and re-organizing in my room and basement. I found myself thinking about the different ways I could position the light on my desk, stack clothes in my closet, and other simple but meaningful design decisions. That's when I got the idea that there should be an online platform where I could get inspiration from what other people were doing.

Overall, building Design.io was also a great opportunity for me to solidify concepts from the countless web development tutorials I watched. It was a process of learning things when I needed to and reading lots of online documentation. This project will hold a special place in my heart because it was my first self-initiated programming project that I have completed from start to finish.
